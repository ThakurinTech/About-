👋 Hi, I’m @ThakurinTech, a digital humanist passionate about harnessing the power of data for social good, with a particular focus on cultural analytics and educational equity. 

I’m interested in projects that leverage cultural analytics to uncover insights into social dynamics, trends, and patterns, aiming to inform policies and initiatives that promote inclusivity and equality.

🌱 I’m currently exploring the intersection of machine learning and cultural studies, learning how data-driven approaches can illuminate the complexities of cultural phenomena and support sustainable, community-driven development.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects at the nexus of data science, cultural analytics, and social good, especially those that aim to make a tangible difference in communities by improving educational outcomes and fostering cultural understanding.
